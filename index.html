<p>Student of life and class is in session</p>
<p>I am an enthusiastic, energetic and trusted team player. I have been involved in enterprise automation projects that include SAP Business Objects, IBM Cognos, TM1 planning, data modeling, reporting, data mining, integration services, dashboards, universe, and web intelligence reporting and algorithms.

  I have worked in the financial service industry, and have extensive customer service experience since building great applications comes from understanding the user and their needs.
  
  My undergraduate work involved learning styles, and created an educational system to capture and monitor students learning behavior and helped teachers understand the student and classes, by integrating different data sources, and illustrate problems at a higher and detail level.
